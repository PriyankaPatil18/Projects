       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""

      " b'i am a jane eyre lover and a purist and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book and the characters are portrayed as i imagined them jane eyre is a complex story of great richness and can t be delivered properly in a feature length format so it needs a tv mini series timothy dalton s rochester is probably the best ever there has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age in the book jane the narrator describes him as about 35 and not young but not yet middle aged i think timothy dalton was about 38 when he made this so that is about right also we only have jane s opinion of whether rochester is handsome she only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks as an inexperienced and humble girl i can t imagine her saying she did think him handsome the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man and this is fulfilled to perfection i love the relationship between the two leads which is the crucial thing about this story and the humour of their encounters other versions have blown it but this gets it right the 2006 version with toby stephens aged 37 years is in progress on bbc1 and is very good indeed so i will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed br br on viewing this series again after watching the 2006 version i have decided that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best charlotte bronte s dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story modernisation just doesn t work it s a victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters this version has an excellent cast zelah clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and rochester is important timothy dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor there are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes but leaves out unnecessary details making it to the point and gripping i recommend it to all true jane eyre fans'\n",

      " b'i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn t understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he s a pretty good actor i only see him getting better br br it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don t really care to watch another episode br br i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities'\n",
      " b'when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called mausolem instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about i will be honest i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree however there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie i was expecting'\n",
      " b'like many others i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time i was sadly mistaken everything negative said about this flic is more than true what takes the cake however is the horrible horrible storyline for the main character br br here s why the planet might be destroyed the only way to recover from it for the entire human race to be saved trough it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground hide out and dennis hopper is the lone seer scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this but what s the main motivation of stevens sonny d angelo he s angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at the hopper character was the boy with the finger in the dike and now stevens is blaming him for picking and choosing and if that isn t enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isn t fair and he s responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity s saviour oh my god how stupid can you get br br what s also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap i mean two million in budget what could have been done with that think clerks blair witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100 000 dollars and were still better aaaaargh i count myself lucky that i didn t pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter ber crap is one the most heroic things i ve done this year it s no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before'\n",

      " b'hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn t without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable i know i can t use this word forever but i can t think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn t rank along the best 7 5 10 bethany cox'\n",

      " b'this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete misnomer since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you ve had enough and it s time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end in my case that s two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim'\n",
      " b'i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the 70s is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clich d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show'\n",

      " b'this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts and undoubtedly christine mcintyre s best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we don t tire of her voice and partly because it blends so well with the stooges antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle s role in the marx brothers a night at the opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera and mcintyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did the stooges buffoonery mcintyre s singing and a well constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars'\n",

      " b'i loved this film not being a swooning ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr br br what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed s we get insight into ed s personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making br br the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background br br fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story br br ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person s legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement br br even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood s legend br br in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling'\n",

      " b'office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right

      " b'quai des orfevres directed by the brilliant henri georges clouzot is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of french film making of the postwar years m clouzot adapting the steeman s novel longtime defence shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that as dbdumonteil has pointed out in this forum it demonstrates how influential cluzot was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are indebted to the master especially claude chabrol br br the crisp black and white cinematography by armand thirard has been magnificently transferred to the criterion dvd we recently watched working with clouzot thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes the music by francis lopez a man who created light music and operettas in france works well in the context of the film since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs br br louis jouvet who is seen as a police detective is perfect in the part this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the french theater jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others in an unfair comment by someone in this page jouvet s inspector is compared with peter falk s columbo the television detective frankly and no disrespect to mr falk intended it s like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine br br bernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him martineau is vulnerable and doesn t act rationally he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn t commit but all the evidence points to the contrary br br the other great character in the film is dora the photographer it s clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies simone renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film suzy delair playing jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like brignon the old lecher br br the film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together'\n",
